# workScheduleApp

## Description
The objective of this project was to create a work day scheduling appication, allowing you to enter and save events into timeblocks and view them after reloading the webpage. This project made use of concepts such as the bootstrap grid system classes and moment.js. The grid system provides a screen responsive layout for the event timeblocks, which feature colors that are dynamically updated by moment.js to reflect the past, current, and future hours of the day.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
Website's URL: 

Open the application to view the current day of the week, month, and year at the top of the page. You can then enter text into the timeblocks next to their respective hours of the work day (9AM-5PM) and click on their matching save button. Upon reloading the page, your entered text will be loaded from the local storage back into the text fields so you can utilize the scheduler without having to worry about closing the page.
